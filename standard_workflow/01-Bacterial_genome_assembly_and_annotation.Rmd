This practical session will run you through a standard bacterial genome assembly and annotation workflow using PacBio data. The topics covered are:

- [Setup](#setup)
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Genome assembly with `Redbean` (`wtdbg2`)](#redbeanassembly)
- [Assembly assessment](#genomeassemblyassessment)
- [Polishing with `arrow`](#polishing)
- [Circularisation with `Circlator`](#Circlator)
- [Annotation with `Prokka`](#annotation)
- [Final report generation with `MultiQC`](#finalreport)

The aim of this practical is to produce a genome assembly of _Eschrichia coli_, annotate it, and produce a report with the assembly's stats. Read QC will be skipped as this has been covered in a previous NEOF workshop.

Commands are in the following font, colour, and box.They should be run in the command line.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo "This is a command example" 
```
